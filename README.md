quadruped
=========

Arduino based 4-footed spider-like robot with 2 Servos per leg.

I will use this file to comment a bit on the project progress and status.

--------
the project shows nice progress; the mechanics made out of plywood and micro-servos are finished; first Arduino-sketches to test basic things (servo positioning/control via Adafruit 16 Channel PWM Shield, servo calibration, basis movement of the robot; work took place primarily in the quadruped/tools folder; the code should be self-explanatory
